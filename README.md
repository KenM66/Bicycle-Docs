# Bicycle-Docs

This is a MERN stack program with React on the client side, and Node.JS with Express referencing a Mongo Database on the server side. 

To run the program, you would need to create a MongoDB cluster with the variable names as well as a JSON ignore file with the same variable names, or replace with your variables.   The program will not execute as is without a back end to reference. 

The other option is to create a mock api with the same axios reference links and run only the client.
